# Vox2Cub
 A small, quick application for converting .vox and .qb files to .cub files.
 
 Programs such as [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) can be used to create .vox and .qb files, which can be converted to .cub (CubeWorld) files with this tool. This program uses the [Voxels library.](https://github.com/Arlorean/Voxels.Core)

## To Use
* Place all of your .vox and .qb files in one folder
* Copy the full location of the folder containing your .vox and .qb files
* Open Vox2Cub and paste the folder location
* Press the enter key to begin conversion
